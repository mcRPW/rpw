# Technical details


## Working directory

RPW lives in a folder called `.mcRPW`, which is located in the same place as 
Minecraft's one, `.minecraft`.

On linux, that would be `~/.mcRPW`, on Windows `%APPDATA%/.mcRPW`.


## Used software

The RPW's GUI is made using *SwingX* and the images are scaled up or down with 
a library called *Thumbnailator*. Other used libraries are *GSON* and 
*MarkDown4j*.

The built-in text editors are based on an amazing highlighter component called 
*RSyntaxTextArea*.


## Licence & Sharing

The tool is released as a free software under the terms of the MIT license.

The used libraries, however, have various licenses, so be respectful to them.
